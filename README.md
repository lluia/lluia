## Welcome ðŸª´ 

Hey, I'm Lluis. Currently living in Lund, Sweden. I was born in Barcelona <img src="./images/sun.png" width="15" aria-label="Sun icon" />. 

I've been writing code (mostly Front-end) for about 10 years ðŸ’­

I follow [digital minimalism](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525536515/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0525536515&linkCode=as2&tag=minimalismmad-20&linkId=2df956dd47bb1616c9e4e5f99f2fdb97) and from time to time a nomad lifestyle. 

Aside from coding I love travelling ðŸŽ’ and photography ðŸ“¸ !

I help maintain [Auth.js](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth), open source for the win. You can reach me at hi@ubbe.dev.

4. Declarative > Imperative code
